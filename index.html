                    <p>Hello! I'm Parnika, an upcoming sophomore student at the American University of Sharjah (AUS). My hobbies include singing, photography, and cooking. I've always had a passion for coding and a curiosity about how things work. Whether it's understanding the mechanics behind a game or diving into complex programming tasks, I love the challenge and creativity coding offers. Even though coding can be challenging, my passion for it keeps me motivated. I am determined to build and create projects that make a difference. Join me on my journey as I continue to learn, grow, and develop my skills in the world of coding and technology.</p>
